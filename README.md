# Smart City Assistant
##### An Android App developed by Kyriakos Giannakis (kerk12) and Vasilis Zografos, as part of the Graphical User Interface course on University of Piraeus (Fall Semester 2016-2017).

It is divided into 4 parts:
- Smart Schedule Planner: Used for managing a person's daily schedule. It helps pinpoint the places the person wants to go to and displays the route on a map. It uses the [Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/android/), [Directions](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/) and [Places API](https://developers.google.com/places/) by Google.
- Smart Home: Manages a person's smart devices.
- Food/Coffee Ordering: The person can order coffee and food online. It uses a dummy dataset.
- Elder Monitoring System: Used for monitoring a person's relatives.

## NOTE: All the operations depicted in the app (except the Smart Schedule Planner) are virtual. They do NOT work in reality.
